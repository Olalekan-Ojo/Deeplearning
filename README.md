# Deeplearning
Exploring deep learning architectures, featuring state-of-the-art models such as MobileNet, Inception, YOLO, Efficient CNN, VGG16, ResNet etc for technology-driven solutions in computer vision and artificial intelligence
  
Projects:  
* Tomato Disease detection using VGG16 Deep learning model  
* Pothole detection using MobileNetV2 and InceptionV3 Deep learning model  
* Pothole detection using Object detection algorithm such as Yolo v7 and Yolo v8   
  * This is aimed as a solution for autonomous cars in regions of the world with teriible road conditions.   
  * The model identifies Potholes of 2 categories, potholes with or without water; This will aid the response of the ADS to the pothole
  * The accuracy of the models gave a 92.50% or 95.83 for MobileNetV2 and InceptionV3 respectively
  * Moddel was evalauted using confusion matrix.
* Farm disease detection using mobileNetv2 and inception v3 model. 
* Encoders and Autocoders
